# Form Fundaments

> The goal of our pilot phase is to gather feedback from a private group of users.
> Therefore, during this phase, we kindly ask you to:

`Form control`s are the most fundamental building block of the Forms. They are the basis of
both `field`s and `fieldset`s, and the `form` itself.

## Fields

Fields are the actual form controls the end user interacts with.
They extend the `Field` class, which on its turn uses the `FormControlMixin`.
Fields provide a normalized, predictable API for platform components and custom made form controls.
On top of this, they feature:

- data synchronization with models
- formatting of view values
- advanced validation possibilities
- creation of advanced user interaction scenarios via `interaction states`
- provision of labels and help texts in an easy, declarative manner
- better focus management
- accessibility out of the box
- advanced styling possibilities: map your own Design System to the internal HTML structure

### Platform fields (wrappers)

- [`LionInput`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/input), a wrapper for `<input>`
- [`LionTextarea`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/textarea), a wrapper for `<textarea>`
- [`LionSelect`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/select), a wrapper for `<select>`
- [`LionRadio`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/radio), a wrapper for `<input type="radio">`
- [`LionCheckbox`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/checkbox), a wrapper for `<input type="checkbox">`

### Custom fields (wrappers)

Whenever a native form control doesn't exist or is not sufficient, a
[custom form field](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/field/docs/CustomFieldsTutorial.md) should be created. One could think of components
like:

- slider
- combobox
- autocomplete
- etc...

## Fieldsets

Fieldsets are groups of fields. They can be considered fields on their own as well, since they
partly share the normalized api via `FormControlMixin`.
Fieldsets are the basis for:

- [`LionFieldset`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/fieldset)
- [`LionForm`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/form)
- [`LionRadioGroup`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/radio-group)
- [`LionCheckboxGroup`](https://github.com/ing-bank/lion/blob/master/packages/checkbox-group)
